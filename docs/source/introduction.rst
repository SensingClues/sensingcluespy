Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

`SensingClues <https://sensingclues.org/>`_ allows you to record, monitor and analyze wildlife observations to support nature conservation initiatives.
The package ``sensingcluespy`` allows Python-users to connect to SensingClues' database and download
data logged using the Cluey-app. This includes wildlife observations and tracks, custom map layers,
and the wildlife ontology used by SensingClues.

**Note:** you need credentials for the SensingClues `Cluey <https://sensingclues.org/cluey>`_-app to
connect to the database. However, the tutorial notebook uses a read-only demo-user, allowing you to explore the available functionality, even without your own Cluey-account.
